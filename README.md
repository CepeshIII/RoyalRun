### ✨ Features

3D Runner Gameplay – The player runs forward automatically along a narrow bridge, dodging obstacles in real time.

Dynamic & Static Obstacles – The game features both stationary and moving obstacles, generated procedurally during gameplay.

Checkpoint Timer System – Players have a limited amount of time to run. Reaching a checkpoint adds extra time, creating tension and pacing.

Third-Person Cinematic Camera – Built with Cinemachine for smooth and immersive camera transitions.

Modern Input Handling – Utilizes Unity’s New Input System for responsive and extensible control support.

URP Visuals – Enhanced graphics with the Universal Render Pipeline, including lighting and post-processing.
